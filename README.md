## About me
I am a **theoretical physicist**, currently doing a MSc in Astrophysics, Particle Physics and Cosmology at the University of Barcelona. I have been working with numerical codes in my past projects, which you may find in my account.

## Past and present projects
I am currently working:
- **Neural Quantum States**: Variational representations of quantum many-body wavefunctions where a neural network parametrizes the state amplitudes. I use this framework to approximate the ground states of quantum field theories whose     solutions are not analytically accessible. Combined with variational Monte Carlo optimization, NQS provide an efficient method to obtain these states and estimate their energies. Working in `Python`.

Even though I am currently working on concepts more related to nuclear physics, in the past I have been working on:
- **Primordial black hole formation**: I worked with a public `Python` code, which I adapted to my specific case, to study the formation of primordial black holes from cosmological overdensities. The implementation solved the corresponding evolution equations to determine the critical threshold values for collapse.
- **Formation and evolution of cosmic domain walls**: As part of a summer internship I did in 2025, I worked with `Python` and `C/C++` simulation codes to study the formation and evolution of cosmic domain walls. This involved numerical analysis of field dynamics and post-processing of simulation data to characterize the properties and scaling behavior of domain wall networks.
